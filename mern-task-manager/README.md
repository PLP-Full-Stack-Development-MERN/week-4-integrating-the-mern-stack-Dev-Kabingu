# Task Management System

## Project Overview
Welcome to my Task Management System. This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project allows me to manage tasks with functionalities to create new tasks, view task details, update existing tasks, and delete tasks. It serves as a practical example of implementing CRUD operations in a full-stack JavaScript environment.

## Installation Steps

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on my machine
- MongoDB installed and running

### Backend Setup and Frontend setup
 Clone the repository:
Create the folder "mern-task-manager"
   git clone https://github.com/PLP-Full-Stack-Development-MERN/week-4-integrating-the-mern-stack-Dev-Kabingu.git
   cd mern-task-manager
   created two folders for client( frontend code) and the server (backend code) and installed the necessary components
